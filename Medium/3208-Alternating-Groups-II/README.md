### **Algorithm: Counting Alternating Groups of Size k**  
We will implement an algorithm that finds the number of **alternating** groups of size `k` in a list of colors.

### **Approach**
1. **Sliding Window Technique:**  
   - We use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to track a valid group.
   - We ensure no adjacent elements are the same.
   - We count valid groups of size `k`.

2. **Handling Circular Groups:**  
   - We extend the list by appending the first `k-1` elements to the end.
   - This allows us to check groups that wrap around.

### **Dry Run of Algorithm**
#### **Input**
```cpp
colors = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], k = 3
```
#### **Step 1: Extend the Array**
```cpp
Extended colors = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2]  // First k-1 elements added at the end
```

#### **Step 2: Start the Sliding Window**
| Step | start | end | Window | Valid? | Count (`ans`) |
|------|-------|-----|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1    | 0     | 1   | [1,2]  | ❌ (size < k) | 0 |
| 2    | 0     | 2   | [1,2,3] | ✅ | 1 |
| 3    | 1     | 3   | [2,3,2] | ✅ | 2 |
| 4    | 2     | 4   | [3,2,1] | ✅ | 3 |
| 5    | 3     | 5   | [2,1,1] | ❌ (1 repeats) | 3 |
| 6    | 4     | 6   | [1,1,2] | ❌ (1 repeats) | 3 |

**Final Answer:**
```cpp
ans = 3
```

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Extending the array:** \(O(k)\)
- **Sliding window traversal:** \(O(n)\)  
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(n + k) \approx O(n)\)

### **Conclusion**
- The algorithm efficiently finds valid alternating groups.
- It handles circular cases without extra complexity.
- The sliding window technique ensures optimal performance.


Explaination:

Let's break this algorithm down step by step in a simple way.  

### **Problem Understanding**  
We are given a list of colors (`colors`) represented as integers. We want to find the number of **alternating groups** of size `k`. An **alternating group** means that no two adjacent elements in the group are the same.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**  

1. **Extending the Array**  
   ```cpp
   for(int i=0; i<k-1; i++) {
       colors.push_back(colors[i]);
   }
   ```
   - This step extends the array by adding the first `k-1` elements to the end.  
   - This helps in handling circular sequences efficiently.

2. **Setting Up Variables**  
   ```cpp
   int start = 0, end = 1, ans = 0;
   ```
   - `start`: Marks the beginning of a potential alternating group.  
   - `end`: Moves forward to check for valid groups.  
   - `ans`: Stores the count of valid alternating groups.

3. **Iterate Through Colors**  
   ```cpp
   while(end < colors.size()) {
   ```
   - We use a **while loop** to go through the list.

4. **Handle Consecutive Same Colors**  
   ```cpp
   if(colors[end] == colors[end-1]) {
       start = end;
       end++;
       continue;
   }
   ```
   - If two consecutive colors are the same, reset `start` to `end` and move forward.

5. **Expand the Group Until Size `k`**  
   ```cpp
   end++;
   if(end-start < k) continue;
   ```
   - We keep expanding `end` until the window size reaches `k`.

6. **Count the Valid Group and Move Forward**  
   ```cpp
   start++;
   ans++;
   ```
   - Once we have a valid alternating group of size `k`, we increase `ans` and move `start` forward to look for more groups.

---

### **Final Answer**  
The function returns the total count of valid alternating groups:
```cpp
return ans;
```

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Input**
```cpp
colors = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
k = 3
```
#### **Processing**
1. Extend array: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2]`
2. Find valid alternating groups of size `k=3`
   - `[1,2,3]` ✅
   - `[2,3,2]` ✅
   - `[3,2,1]` ✅

#### **Output**
```cpp
ans = 3
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- The algorithm ensures there are no consecutive same elements in a group.
- It efficiently finds valid alternating groups using a sliding window approach.
- The extension step helps handle circular sequences.
